# Newton's Laws of Motion

Sir Isaac Newton formulated three laws that form the foundation of classical mechanics.

## First Law (Inertia)

An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion.

## Second Law (F = ma)

Force equals mass times acceleration.

## Third Law (Action-Reaction)

For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
