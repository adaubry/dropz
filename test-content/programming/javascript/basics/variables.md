# JavaScript Variables

Learn how to declare and use variables in JavaScript.

## Variable Declarations

- `var` - function-scoped (legacy)
- `let` - block-scoped (modern)
- `const` - block-scoped constant (modern)

## Best Practices

Always use `const` by default, and only use `let` when you need to reassign.
